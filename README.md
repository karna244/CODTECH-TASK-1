TASK 1 
Certainly! Below is an explanation of a C program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program will enable users to input a temperature in one scale and convert it to the other two scales.
Program Overview
The program performs the following steps:

User Input: It prompts the user to enter a temperature value and specify the scale (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin).
Conversion Logic: Based on the input scale, it applies the appropriate conversion formulas to calculate the equivalent temperatures in the other two scales.
Output: Finally, it displays the converted temperatures to the user.
Temperature Conversion Formulas
The following formulas are used for temperature conversion:

How It Works
Input Handling:

The program first prompts the user to enter a temperature value and its scale using scanf().
It reads the scale character while ensuring that it correctly captures input (the space before %c in scanf helps ignore whitespace).
Conversion Logic:

The convert_temperature function takes the temperature and scale as arguments.
A switch statement determines the scale and performs the appropriate conversions based on the input:
For Celsius: Converts to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
For Fahrenheit: Converts to Celsius and Kelvin.
For Kelvin: Converts to Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Each conversion is calculated using the defined formulas.
Output:

The results are displayed using printf(), formatted to two decimal places for clarity.
Additional Features to Consider
Input Validation: You can enhance the program by checking if the entered temperature is a valid number and if the scale is one of the allowed characters (C, F, K).
Loop for Continuous Input: Implement a loop to allow the user to perform multiple conversions without restarting the program.
Error Handling: Add error messages for invalid inputs, making the program more user-friendly.
Conclusion
This C program provides a straightforward way to convert temperatures among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It's useful for anyone needing to quickly perform temperature conversions, such as students or professionals in scientific fields.



TASK 2 
Creating a student management system in C involves designing a program that can handle student registrations, maintain records, and calculate grades. This system will allow users to add, edit, and delete student information efficiently. Below, Iâ€™ll outline the components and provide a basic implementation of such a system.

Program Overview
The student management system will consist of several functionalities:

Data Structure: Define a structure to hold student information (e.g., name, ID, grades).
Add Student: Functionality to register a new student.
Edit Student: Update details for an existing student.
Delete Student: Remove a student record from the system.
View Students: Display all student records.
Calculate Grades: Compute and display grades based on recorded marks.
Data Structure
You can define a structure to hold student information, including attributes like ID, name, and grades.
Explanation of the Code
Data Structure: The Student structure holds student ID, name, grades, and average.
Functions:
add_student(): Prompts for student details and calculates the average grade.
edit_student(): Allows the user to find a student by ID and update their details.
delete_student(): Finds and removes a student based on ID.
view_students(): Displays all student records, including their average grades.
Main Loop: A menu-driven interface allows users to choose actions until they decide to exit.
Additional Features to Consider
Input Validation: Ensure user inputs are valid (e.g., numeric grades, valid IDs).
File Storage: Implement functionality to save and load student records from a file for persistent storage.
Error Handling: Improve error handling for invalid operations (e.g., editing a non-existent student).
Dynamic Memory: Use dynamic memory allocation (e.g., with malloc) for handling an arbitrary number of students.
Conclusion
This C program provides a basic framework for a student management system, allowing for the addition, editing, deletion, and viewing of student records. It can be expanded with additional features and improvements based on specific requirements.
